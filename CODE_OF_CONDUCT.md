# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in **HUB Portal** (formerly HelloCeloV2) a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism  
- Focusing on what is best for the community  
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Respecting user privacy and data in our decentralized chat application

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances  
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others' private information, such as wallet addresses or personal data, without explicit permission  
- Spamming, scamming, or any form of malicious activity in the chat application
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by creating a private issue in the GitHub repository or through the designated reporting channels mentioned in the project documentation.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. This includes but is not limited to:

- GitHub repositories and discussions
- The HUB Portal chat application
- Social media accounts representing the project
- Community forums and chat channels
- Online or offline events

Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported through the project's designated reporting channels. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to enforce this Code of Conduct in all project spaces and may also apply it to public spaces when an individual is representing the project.  
Violations of the Code of Conduct may result in temporary or permanent bans from the project community.

## Privacy and Security

Given the decentralized nature of HUB Portal, we emphasize:
- Respect for user privacy and wallet addresses
- Zero tolerance for spam or scam attempts
- Protection against harassment through private messaging features
- Responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities
